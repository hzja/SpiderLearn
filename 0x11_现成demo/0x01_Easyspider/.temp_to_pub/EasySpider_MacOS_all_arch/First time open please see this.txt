Due to the complex security settings of MacOS, the issue of being unable to open software due to the "unverified developer" message may occur upon the first attempt to open the software. Please refer to the following GitHub document to see how to open software and perform tasks on your MacOS version:

For the Arm version, if it shows "the package is damaged", you need to use the following command to modify the package attributes:

xattr -cr Your EasySpider.app file path
 
For example:

xattr -cr /Users/your_username/Downloads/EasySpider_MacOS_all_arch/EasySpider.app
 
Then try to open it again.

File access permissions must be granted, microphone permissions are not necessary at all, and the author is not sure why microphone permissions are being requested, so they can be declined.
